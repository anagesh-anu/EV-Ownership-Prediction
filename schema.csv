"? Higher Electricity Usage ? ? More Likely to Have an EV

    If Total_Electricity_Usage_kWh > 900, higher chance of owning an EV.
    If < 600 kWh, lower probability.

? Charging Infrastructure ? Strongest Indicator

    If Charging_Type = ""Level 1"", ""Level 2"", or ""DC Fast"" ? Must have an EV.
    If Charging_Type = ""None"", much lower probability."
"? Home Type & Space Consideration

    Detached Houses are more likely to have an EV.
    Apartments are less likely (due to parking & charging constraints).

? Proximity to Charging Stations

    If Nearby_Charging_Station_Distance_km > 10 km, less likely to have an EV.
    If < 2 km, slightly higher probability."
"? Income & Lifestyle Impact

    If Household_Income_kUSD > 100, significantly increases EV probability.
    If Household_Income_kUSD < 50, lower EV probability.

? Solar Panels & Environmental Mindset

    If Has_Solar_Panels = 1, higher chance of EV ownership.

? Geographic & Weather Considerations

    If Geographic_Location_Score > 80, higher likelihood of EV adoption.
    If Avg_Temperature_C < -5°C, slightly lower probability (battery efficiency concerns).

? More Vehicles in Household = Higher Chance of an EV

    If Num_Vehicles > 1, higher chance of at least one being an EV."
